     <b>ABOUT BOOK:</b> <br><br>

     George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series has become, in many ways, the gold standard for modern epic fantasy. <br>Martin—dubbed the "American Tolkien" by Time magazine—has created a world that is as rich and vital as any piece of historical fiction, set in an age of knights and chivalry and filled with a plethora of fascinating, multidimensional characters that you love, hate to love, or love to hate as they struggle for control of a divided kingdom.<br> It is this very vitality that has led it to be adapted as the HBO miniseries “Game of Thrones.”<br>
     <br>
     The series includes the following novels:<br><br>
     A GAME OF THRONES<br>
     A CLASH OF KINGS<br>
     A STORM OF SWORDS<br>
     A FEAST FOR CROWS<br>

     <b> 1.</b> "An amazing world with well written characters, and compelling themes! The first, I would say, 30% of the book was rather a grind to get through. It wasn't bad, just a bit boring.<br> The rest is just pure expert storytelling. The unique way of not having the usual chapters but instead having different point of views where we could read and see what each character is going through is one my favourite things."
     <br><br>
     <b>2.</b> " Probably the best part of the series is how it tells you one thing and then twists the entire story around good guys and heroes die while the bad live, but theres not a define bad or good guy, you may hate tyrion but he is A god guy  in some ways. <br>This book is a masterpiece at introducing a massive 8 book saga and will always hold a special place in my heart."

     <b>1.</b> This book was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>I decided to read it because it looked interesting and I love dystopian fiction, and I certainly did NOT regret it. <br>I finished the Maze Runner in a day and am jumping to the second book right away because this is by far the BEST thriller I've ever read!!!!! <br>Definitely LOADS better than The Hunger Games in my opinion. <br>Has way more action sequences, a better plot, so much intriguing mystery, way less romance (FINALLYYYY). <br>Sure it has some bad language usage, but bravery, courage, and selflessness are portrayed beautifully in it's AWESOME characters.<br> The action sequences are so intense, my heart was literally pounding in anticipation when reading them, and at some parts, I got so nervous that my stomach turned sour!!!!!!<br> This book got me hooked right from the beginning, definitely recommend it to YA adult readers who are looking for an interesting dystopian read.<br>
     <br>
     <b>2.</b> Let’s just start with, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!<br> So much great detail and it has one of the most incredible story ever. <br>This book also has so many great cliff hangers. Every chapter makes you wonder what happens in the next chapter. It also has interesting dialogue as the use different words to say something like good that or shuck it. <br>Wonderful adventure and I definitely recommend this to people in 5th grade and up.<br>

     <b>1.</b>One thing I could say after watching 'Gone Girl' is I am becoming a  David Fincher fan and looking forward to watching his other movies too. This film is a suspense-thriller in which a lady psychopath tries to take revenge in wrath. The movie was engrossing and attracted me as moth gets attracted to light.
     <br>It definitely had twists and turns which are the core of suspense movies, the storytelling was amazing. First, it makes you think that something has happened, then you understand what actually happened and the story doesn't end up there, it becomes more interesting and keeps the viewers on their nerves as it gets difficult for them to predict the outcome.
     <br>Although the storyline was pretty much interesting, the climax was a bit disappointing for me, it could have been better but they somehow tried to make it neutral. Nick(male protagonist) ends up with his wife Amy(female protagonist) at the end after all that stuff that happened was getting difficult for me to digest.
     Overall, it's a pretty good movie that will take you to David Fincher's different world for two hours, Don't miss a chance to get into this world!!<br>
     <br><br><b>2.</b> I would rate the novel as mediocre. Although i still got movie to watch, but as far as novel is concerned it's bit of a overhyped. Sociopathy was interesting so was the story. Characters were different yet believable. But the overhyped rating and reviews got me so excited about the novel that when i finally read it....it turn out as average. I bet if someone read this book without any prior prejudice set by ratings and reviews, that person will find it amazing. 
     Personally ( my individual opinion) i found the story a bit stretched and Amy's confession quite unreasonable. Suspense and twist could be much better.
     If you want to read the book...go ahead by all means. But, do not set any type of prejudice or expectation and It will turn out to be an interesting read.<br>
